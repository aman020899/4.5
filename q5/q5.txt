A favicon is a small icon associated with a website that appears in the browser's address bar,
 tabs, bookmarks, and other areas of the user interface. It stands for "favorites icon" and is 
 typically a square image with dimensions of 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels, though higher resolutions 
 are also supported. Favicons help users identify and distinguish between different websites when 
 multiple tabs or bookmarks are open in a browser.
